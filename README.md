*   Select a configuration from Design Options for detailed checks.

For Masonry sections, input $v_m$ (masonry shear strength) as per NZS 4230.  
Option to waive minimum shear reinforcement checks as per NZS 3101 Cl. 9.3.9.4.13 (e.g., slabs ‚â§ 250 mm).

Detailed checks include:
*   Minimum reinforcement area, $A_{s,Min}$
*   Neutral axis depth, $c$ (to avoid premature concrete failure)
*   Flexural and shear capacities ($\phi M_n$ and $\phi V_n$)
*   Minimum stirrup area, $A_{sv,Min}$
*   Maximum stirrup spacing, $s_s$, and leg spacing, $s_l$
>üí°Note: Recommended options may not fully satisfy all checks. Adjust reinforcement and re-check as needed.

### 3.7 SLS Checks
Input:

*   Concrete shrinkage strain (typical 400‚Äì700 √ó 10‚Åª‚Å∂ in New Zealand)
*   Crack width limit, $w_{max}$ (default 0.3 mm, as per NZS 3101 Table C2.1 or project requirements)

Outputs:
*   Steel stress under ULS and SLS, $f_{su}$ and $f_{ss}$
*   Additional steel stress due to concrete shrinkage
*   Calculated crack width, $w$ (mm)
*   Effective second moment of area ($I_e$)
*   Long-term creep factor, $K_{cp}$ (per NZS 3101 Section 6.8)
>üí°Note: If the calculated crack width exceeds the limit, increase main reinforcement area and re-check.
>‚ùóNote: SLS checks are not applicable for masonry sections.

### Project Management
*   Use the sidebar menu ‚ò∞ to create a new project, save the current project to a `.json` file, or load a previously saved project.
*   Saved files include all input data for easy resumption of work. After loaded a saved file, it needs to run all the checks again to get all the outputs.

## 4. Design Options Generation

The application automatically generates and evaluates reinforcement layouts for rectangular beams based on the input design forces, geometry, and material properties.
#### Preliminary vs Detailed Checks

- **Preliminary sizing:** Design Options generation uses the steel yield stress ($f_y$) as the tension force for moment capacity checks (i.e. $T=A_sf_y$). This provides a conservative and fast screening of candidate layouts and ensures preliminary moment capacity is not under-estimated.

- **Detailed verification:** The actual steel stress (elastic or yielded) and neutral axis location are computed in the Detailed Design phase. The detailed check evaluates the elastic steel stress $f_s = E_s Œµ_s$ and will switch to the yielded branch where appropriate (however, overstrength behavior beyond yield is not considered in the current version). Where the yielded assumption applies ($f_s=f_y$), the corresponding ultimate flexural capacity is accepted as the section‚Äôs design strength.

- **Warning / remediation:** If a candidate passes the preliminary check but fails detailed verification (e.g., section too shallow, excessive $f_s$, or shear/minimum reinforcement checks), the option is flagged and the designer should increase As, change bar layout, or adjust geometry.

### Bar Sizes & Stirrup Options

-   **Main reinforcement bars (db):** 12, 16, 20, 25 mm
-   **Stirrups (ds):** 6, 10, 12 mm
-   **Stirrup legs:** 2, 3, or 4
-   **Stirrup spacing (s<sub>s</sub>):** 50‚Äì300 mm (in increments of 50 mm)

### Process

#### 1. Stress Block Factor (Œ±‚ÇÅ,Œ≤‚ÇÅ) as per NZS 3101 7.4.27.
$$\alpha_1 = 0.85 \text{ where, f'c <55MPa}$$
  

$$
\beta_1 =
\begin{cases}
0.85 & \text{if } f_c' \le 30 \text{ MPa} \\
0.85 - 0.008(f_c' - 30), \text{ with a minimum of 0.65} & \text{if } f_c' > 30 \text{ MPa}
\end{cases}
$$

#### 2. Effective Depth (d)
$$
d = D - \text{cover} - d_s - \frac{d_b}{2}
$$

#### 3. Minimum Steel Area (A<sub>s,min</sub>) (NZS 3101)
$$
A_{s,min} = \frac{\sqrt{f_c'}}{4f_y} b d
$$

#### 4. Required Steel Area (A<sub>s,req</sub>)
To calculate thee required steel area, start with the moment capacity equation:

$$
\frac{M^*}{\phi_b} = T \left( d_0 - \frac{1}{2} a \right)
$$

*where,*

$$a = \frac{C}{\alpha_1 f_c' B}$$

Under equilibrium, we assume the tensile force $T$ equals the compressive force $C$, and is determined by the steel yield:

$$
T = C = A_s f_y
$$

Substitute the expressions for $a$ and $T$ into the moment equation:

$$
\frac{M^*}{\phi_b} = A_s f_y \left( d_0 - \frac{1}{2} \frac{A_s f_y}{\alpha_1 f_c' B} \right)
$$

Rearrange the terms to form a quadratic equation in the form of $a_q x^2 + b_q x + c_q = 0$, where the unknown is the area of steel, $A_s$:

$$
\underbrace{\left( \frac{f_y^2}{2 \alpha_1 f_c' B} \right)}_{a_q} A_s^2 - \underbrace{\left( f_y d_0 \right)}_{b_q} A_s + \underbrace{\left( \frac{M^*}{\phi_b} \right)}_{c_q} = 0
$$

This is calculated from the quadratic equilibrium equation where:

- $$a = \frac{f_y^2}{2 \alpha_1 f_c' b}$$
- $$b = -f_y d$$
- $$c = \frac{M}{\phi_b}$$

The required steel area is the minimum positive root of:

$$
A_{s,req} = \min\left(\frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\right)
$$

#### 5. Provided Steel Area (A<sub>s,prov</sub>)

$$
A_{s,prov} = n \cdot \frac{\pi d_b^2}{4}
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;*Where, 'n' is the number of bars.*

#### 6. Bar Spacing Check
This step ensures that the reinforcing bars fit within a single layer with a clear spacing greater than or equal to the maximum of the bar diameter (db) and 25 mm. Layouts requiring multiple layers are flagged with a warning.
> ‚ùó Note: Multi-layer layouts are not supported in this version. Use larger bars or increase section depth if needed.

#### 7. Nominal Moment Capacity (M‚Çô)
First, calculate the depth of the equivalent rectangular stress block:

$$
a = \frac{A_{s,prov} f_y}{\alpha_1 f_c' b}
$$

Then, calculate the nominal moment capacity:

$$
M_n = A_{s,prov} f_y \left(d - \frac{a}{2}\right)
$$

#### 8. Moment Utilization Ratio (M<sub>util</sub>)
$$
M_{util} = \frac{M^*}{\phi_b M_n}
$$

#### 9. Shear Capacity
**Concrete Shear Contribution (V<sub>c</sub>):**
Based on NZS 3101 expressions, with the following limits:

$$
V_c = v_c b d
$$

*Where v<sub>c</sub> is between [0.08‚àöf<sub>c</sub>', 0.2‚àöf<sub>c</sub>'] and the nominal shear stress v<sub>n</sub> ‚â§ min(0.2f<sub>c</sub>', 8 MPa).*
>üí° Note: the minimum shear stress of the concrete is defined to min(0.2f<sub>c</sub>', 10 MPa).  
&emsp; For masonry sections, v<sub>c</sub> is taken as 0 (masonry shear strength) in the design options generating process.

**Stirrups Contribution (V<sub>s</sub>):**

$$
V_s = \frac{A_v f_{ys} d}{s}
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp; *Where the area of shear reinforcement A<sub>v</sub> is:*

$$
A_v = \text{legs} \cdot \frac{\pi d_s^2}{4}
$$

**Total Shear Capacity (V<sub>n</sub>):**

$$
V_n = V_c + V_s
$$

#### 10. Shear Utilization Ratio (V<sub>util</sub>)
$$
V_{util} = \frac{V^*}{\phi_s V_n}
$$

### Result Filtering

-   Only options where both **M<sub>util</sub> ‚â§ 0.95** and **V<sub>util</sub> ‚â§ 0.95** are retained.
-   Warnings are issued for designs with insufficient reinforcement or bar spacing conflicts.

### Ranking

-   Valid options are sorted by their combined utilization (**M<sub>util</sub> + V<sub>util</sub>**) to highlight the most efficient layouts.

## 5. Detailed Design and SLS Checks
### 5.1. Overview

After generating reinforcement options, the Detailed Design phase performs a comprehensive verification of the selected configuration. The checks evaluate:

-   Neutral axis depth and ductility
-   Moment and shear capacity
-   Minimum and maximum reinforcement limits
-   Stirrup layout constraints

Furthermore, The SLS Design ensures that beam deflections, crack widths, and rebar stresses under service loads remain within acceptable limits. It incorporates:

-   Elastic or yielded steel stress evaluation under service moments
-   Additional steel stress induced by concrete shrinkage
-   Crack width estimation
-   Effective stiffness of the cracked section
-   Long-term deflection factors (creep, sustained loads)

The process ensures compliance with NZS 3101 and flags any adjustments needed before finalizing the design.

### 5.2. Detailed Check Process

#### Effective Depth and Reinforcement Area

-   Calculates effective depth $d = D - \text{cover} - d_s - d_b/2$
-   Calculates total tension reinforcement area $A_s = n \cdot (\pi d_b^2 / 4)$
-   Computes reinforcement ratio $\rho = A_s / (B \cdot d)$

#### Minimum Reinforcement Check
$$
A_{s,min} = \max\left(\frac{\sqrt{f_c'}}{4f_y} B d, \frac{1.4}{f_y} B d\right)
$$
-   Ensures provided $A_s \ge A_{s,min}$

#### Neutral Axis Depth and Ductility

-   Concrete stress block depth:

 $$ a = \frac{A_s f_y}{\alpha_1 f_c' B}, \text{ with } \alpha_1 = 0.85 \text{ for } f_c' \le 55 MPa$$

-   Neutral axis: $c = a / \beta_1$, where $\beta_1$ is per NZS 3101 7.4.27.
-   Checks against ductility limit $c \le 0.75 c_b$, where $c_b = d \cdot \epsilon_c / (\epsilon_c + \epsilon_s)$

#### Moment Capacity Verification

-   Nominal moment capacity: $M_n = A_s f_y (d - a/2)$
-   Design moment: $\phi M_n$ is compared with the applied moment $M^*$

#### Shear Capacity Verification

-   Concrete shear $V_c$ is calculated per material type (concrete or masonry) and section properties
-   Shear reinforcement $V_s = (A_v f_{ys} d) / s$
-   Nominal shear: $V_n = V_c + V_s$
-   Design shear: $\phi_s V_n$ is compared with the applied shear $V^*$

#### Stirrup Checks

-   Minimum shear reinforcement is provided if $V^* > 0.5 \phi_s V_c$ and is not waived.
-   Maximum stirrup spacing $s_{max} = \min(0.5d, 600 \text{ mm})$, adjusted for high shear conditions.
-   Maximum leg spacing is evaluated if multiple legs per stirrup are used.

#### Warnings and Notes
-   **Side bar checks is not provided in this version.**
-   **Where design the capacity for a overstrength loads, reduction factor $\phi$ can be taken as 1.0. But it is notable the overstrength properties, especially for the material strains, are not applied in this version**
-   Any violations, such as insufficient reinforcement or spacing conflicts, are flagged.
-   Notes include component breakdowns (e.g., $V_c$, $V_s$).

### 5.3. SLS (Serviceability Limit State) Checks

#### Input Parameters

-   SLS bending moment $M_{SLS}$
-   Concrete shrinkage strain $\epsilon_{sh}$ (default 400‚Äì700 ¬µŒµ)  
    To estimate shrinkage strain, refer to NZS 3101 Appendix E. However, studies and reashes shows that the shrinkage strain in New Zealand is typically in the range of 400‚Äì700 ¬µŒµ, with considering 50%-70% related humidity and 15¬∞C themal defference to the peak hytration.
-   Crack width limit $w_{max}$ refer to NZS 3101 Table C2.1 (default 0.3 mm).

#### Estimated Steel Stress
Equilibrium (with Whitney block) and moment balance:
-   Compressive force in concrete $C = \alpha_1 f'_c \beta_1 c B$
-   Tensile force in steel $T = A_s f_s$
-   Force and Moment equilibrium $C = T$ and $M_c+M_s+M_n=M^*/\phi_b$  
where, $M_s = T (d - c)$ $Mc = C (c - a/2)$ and $M_n=0$
-   Using $C=T$, the moment equation reduces to:

$$ C (d - \frac{\beta_1}{2}c) = \frac{M^*}{\phi_b} $$

-   Substitute the expression for the compressive force, $C = 0.85 f_c' \beta_1 c B$, into the moment equation:

$$
0.85 f_c' \beta_1 c B \left[ d - \frac{\beta_1}{2} c \right] = \frac{M^*}{\phi_b}
$$

-   This equation is quadratic in terms of the neutral axis depth, $c$. Solving for $c$ yields the physically admissible root:

$$
c = \frac{d - \sqrt{d^2 - \frac{2 M^*/\phi_b}{0.85 f_c' B}}}{\beta_1}
$$

> *Note: The negative root is chosen so that as the applied moment $M^*$ approaches zero, the neutral axis depth $c$ also approaches zero.*

With the neutral axis depth determined, the following can be calculated:
-   **Compressive Force:** $C = 0.85 f_c' \beta_1 c B$
-   **Steel Stress:** $f_s = \displaystyle\frac{C}{A_s}$
-   **Curvature:** $\phi_c = \displaystyle\frac{f_s}{E_s (d - c)}$

- If the computed steel stress $f_s = C/A_s$ exceeds yield $f_y$, the linear-elastic assumption is violated.
In that case, yielded steel case should be solved piecewise:
-   Set $T=A_sf_y$, and solve for $c$ from the force equilibrium $C=T$: 

$$c = \frac{A_s f_y}{0.85 f_c' \beta_1 B} $$
    
-   then check the mement $C(d-0.5*\beta_1c)$ against $M^*$.
#### Shrinkage-Induced Steel Stress
-   Calculates effective reinforcement ratio $\rho = A_s / (B \cdot D)$
-   Computes concrete modulus of elasticity $E_c = 4700 \sqrt{f'_c}$
-   Computes steel modulus of elasticity $E_s = 200000$ MPa
-   Calculates transformed section ratio $n = E_s / E_c$
-   Using the transformed-section simple estimate:

$$ f_{s,c} ‚âà E_s \varepsilon_{sh} \frac{\rho}{1 + \rho n} $$

-   Accounts for additional stress due to concrete shrinkage: $f_{s,sh} = 0.5 f_{s,c}$. Only half of the induced stress is used to account for laboratory-based calibration.

#### Crack Width Estimation

-   **Effective steel stress:**

$$
f_{s,ch} = f_s + 0.5f_{sc}
$$

-   **Maximum distance from extreme fiber to tension steel centroid:**

$$
g_s = \sqrt{\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\text{cover} + d_s + \frac{d_b}{2}\right)^2} - \frac{d_b}{2}
$$

-   **Crack width:**

$$
w = 2 g_s \frac{f_{s,ch}}{E_s} \quad [\text{mm}]
$$

>‚ùóNote: the reinforcement spacing limit for crack control of a slab or wall member is not considered in this version. The user shall check the spacing limit according to NZS 3101.
#### Effective Section Stiffness ($I_e$)

-   **Cracked section inertia:**

$$
I_{cr} = \frac{B x^3}{3} + \frac{E_s}{E_c} A_s (d - x)^2
$$

&nbsp;&nbsp;where, $x$ is the estimated nuetral axis depth for the cracked section (no tension contributed by concrete).
-   **Effective inertia for SLS moment $M_{SLS}$:**

$$
I_e =
\begin{cases}
I_g, & \text{if } M_{SLS} \le M_{cr} \\
\left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_{SLS}}\right)^3 I_g + \left[1 - \left(\frac{M_{cr}}{M_{SLS}}\right)^3\right] I_{cr}, & \text{if } M_{SLS} > M_{cr}
\end{cases}
$$

#### Long-term Factor (Kcp)

This factor accounts for creep and sustained load effects on deflection:

$$
K_{cp} = \frac{2}{1 + 50 \rho'}
$$

Where $\rho'$ is the compression reinforcement ratio. 
>‚ùóNote: The application assumes 2HD12 as compression reinforcement for this calculation.

#### Output

-   Rebar stresses under ULS (Ultimate Limit State) and SLS.
-   Additional rebar stress from shrinkage.
-   Crack width $w$.
-   Effective section stiffness $I_e$ and long-term deflection factor $K_{cp}$.

### 5.4. Integration with Design Options

-   Users select a reinforcement option from the "Design Options Generation" results.
-   The "Detailed Check" recalculates stresses, moments, and shear using actual steel yield assumptions.
-   It flags adjustments for minimum reinforcement, spacing, and ductility violations.
-   The SLS check ensures serviceability criteria are met, including shrinkage effects on cracks and deflection.
